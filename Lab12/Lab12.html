    <p>
    The objective of this lab is to finish up control by implementing a Kalman Filter in the simulated inverted pendulum. 
    <br>

    <h2>Ideal System </h2>
                          First, I ran the code out of the box. It didn't slow to a halt like the previous week's code, but it was fairly stable 

                          <br>
                          <img src="initial_code.PNG" alt="i2c1" width="320" height="320">
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          <b>We calculate new A and B matrices for use with the Kalman Filter, why is this?</b><br>
                          The new Kalman filter uses new A and B matrics compared to last week's code because the Kalman filter discretizes the system as opposed to last week, which was based on continuous time. <br> 
                          <b>What state(s) are we measuring directly, and which states are we estimating</b><br>
                          In the previous week we were measuring all, with a C matrix of <br>
                          <code>
                            <pre>
                            C = np.matrix([[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
                                     [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
                                     [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
                                     [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]]) 
                                   </pre>
                          </code>
                          whereas this week the C matrix is only 
                      <code>
                        <pre>
                          #Measure one state only
                      C = np.matrix([[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]]) 
                      </pre>
                      </code>
                      Indicating that the only state being measured is the fourth, which is theta dot in this code. 
                      <br>
                      Using the function print(control.obsv(P.A,P.C)) I see that the matrix is
                      <br>
                      <img src="obsCA.PNG" alt="i2c1" width="320" height="150">
                      <br> 
                      I think that because the first row has no value in the first columm, the x state is not observable. However, we already knew fromm the C matrix that only theta dot is being observed, and the rest are being estimated. it is only important that the theta dot in this matrix is observable, which it is. 


    <h2>Adding Noise</h2>
                      <br>
                      First to simulate process noise in the Kalman filter, I commented out the line 
                      <code>
                      <pre>
                        #with process noise:
                         dydt = [ydot0 + np.random.randn()*0.01, ydot1 + np.random.randn()*0.01, ydot2 + np.random.randn()*0.01, ydot3 + np.random.randn()*0.01]
                    </pre>
                    </code>
                    The Kalman filter still worked, though slightly less smoothly 
                    <br>
                      <img src="processnoise.PNG" alt="i2c1" width="320" height="320">
                      <br> 
                      I next added in measurement noise, sigma_n. First I tried changing the line <code> sigma = np.eye(4)*0.00001 </code> in runSimulation.py, but that didnt appear to actually affect the filter. Next, I tried changing it within the loop that calculates each state, by adding an element of randomness to the y_kf value that gets passed to the kaulman filter, and that resulted in a noisier output. 
                      <br>
                      <img src="measurementnoise.PNG" alt="i2c1" width="320" height="320">
                      <br> 
                      I used the same level of noise as in the process noise, and it added what looked like a decent amount of noise after looking at the plot. Much more would be difficult to tell the signal over the noise, and much less wouldnt have much impact. 


    <h2>Changing the Initial State</h2>
                        Next, I worked on changing the initial measurements to see if that would throw the filter off. This time I did need to change the value outside the loop, as I was only trying to change the initial condition and not give consistent error for each state of the pendulum running.  I again started with the level of noise, which didnt do a heck of a lot (.01) <code>mu = np.array([[P.z0+.01], [P.zdot0+.01], [P.theta0+.01], [P.thetadot0+.01]])</code>. Next, I pumped it up by a factor of 10 to see what would happen, adding .1 to each state. 
                        <br>
                        <img src="initpoint1.PNG" alt="i2c1" width="320" height="320">
                         <br> 
                         Then, I bumped it up to .5, and that was a real struggle to balance again,  but it was able to measure that. That seems a little bit overly high, as the entire range of x is only -2 to +2, so its good to know the filter will still work with such bad initial conditions. 
                         <br>
                        <img src="initpoint5.PNG" alt="i2c1" width="320" height="320">
                         <br> 


    <h2>Saturation and Deadband</h2>
                    Next, I again added in saturation and deadband as we did in the previous week's lab. Again I went into the loop and found u=-Kr.dot(mu-des_state). I added the same limitations as last week, with a deadband of .275 and a saturation of 1.85
                    <code>
                      <pre>

                        u=-Kr.dot(mu-des_state)
        
                        if(u>0): 
                            if(u>1.85): 
                                u = 1.85 
                            elif(u<.275): 
                                u = 0 #deadband

                        else: 

                            if(u<-1.85): 
                                u = -1.85 
                            elif(u>-.275): 
                               u = 0 #deadband
                      
                    </pre>
                    </code>
                    <br>
                        <img src="DED.PNG" alt="i2c1" width="320" height="320">
                    <br> 
                    To my great relief the kalman filter also did not struggle with this, and kept on just fine. 


    <h2>AB Matrix Adjustments</h2>

                I next worked on "fudging the numbers" for the A and B matrices. 

                      <code>
                      <pre>
                      A = np.matrix([[0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
                          [0.0, -b/m2, -m1*g/m2, 0.0],
                          [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0],
                          [0.0, -b/(m2*ell), -(m1+m2)*g/(m2*ell), 0.0]])

              B = np.array([[0.0], [1.0/m2], [0.0], [1.0/(m2*ell)]])
                    </pre>
                    </code>

                  I increased the matrix by .01 to start with, just as I did with noise and others. That worked fine, so I increased to .1, which also worked. Eventually, pushing it to .5 caused it to slowly drift off screeen, although apparently still be stable<code>Kr = control.place(P.A*1.5,P.B*1.5,dpoles)</code> Below are the (left) .1 increase and (right) .5 increase

                  <br>
                        <img src="ABpoint1.PNG" alt="i2c1" width="320" height="320"><img src="ABpoint5.PNG" alt="i2c1" width="320" height="320">
                    <br> 
                    These numbers seem as though they can be fudged significantly without screwing up the filter too much. 

    <h2>Decreasing Update Time</h2>
                  Finally, I changed the update time T_update in pendulumParam.py. I first cut it to a tenth, down to .01. This still stayed stable. 

                  <br>
                      <img src="Tupdate001.PNG" alt="i2c1" width="320" height="320">
                  <br> 
                  Next, I upped it again to .05, and still it was stable, although very jittery. 
                  <br>
                      <img src="Tupdate005.PNG" alt="i2c1" width="320" height="320">
                  <br> 
                  I again increased to .1, and that caused the pendulum to become unstable. This is not all that surprising, as ten updates a second is nothing in terms of control needs. Also, our artemis would be more than capable of 20 times a second. 
    <h2>More checks</h2>
    Now that I had confirmed the filter works with my robots parameters, I decided to see how far I could push the simulation by exaggerating known parameters. I started with deadband, incrasing it to almost double because I know the wheels can stick sometimes. 
    <br>
                      <img src="dedpoint5.PNG" alt="i2c1" width="320" height="320">
                  <br> 

                  The deadband actually worked up until around a deadband of u=1, which is pretty crazy and way better than last week's method. 
                  <br>
                      <img src="chaos.PNG" alt="i2c1" width="320" height="320">
                  <br> 
                Next, I put deadband back to a reasonable value of .4 and played with noise. I increased process noise by a factor of 10, and that still managed to stabilize the pendulum. The pendulum at this state, with all the possible variables just a little wrong, is very jittery, which is what I would expect if I were to try and put this on my real robot, but it still works. 
    <h2>Conclusions</h2>
    In the end, with all the changes, I was still able to make the pendulum stabilize. Although this might lead the naive reader to guess that this would work on the actual robot, I know it better than that and still don't believe it would work on the real robot, especially if Professor Peterson herself couldn't get it working.
