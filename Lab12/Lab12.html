    <p>
    The objective of this lab is to finish up control by implementing a Kalman Filter in the simulated inverted pendulum.

    <h2>Ideal System </h2>
                          First, I ran the code out of the box. It didn't slow to a halt like the previous week's code, but it was fairly stable 

                          <br>

                          <br>
                          <b>We calculate new A and B matrices for use with the Kalman Filter, why is this?</b>
                          The new Kalman filter uses new A and B matrics compared to last week's code because the Kalman filter discretizes the system as opposed to last week, which was based on continuous time.  
                          <b>What state(s) are we measuring directly, and which states are we estimating</b>
                          In the previous week we were measuring all, with a C matrix of 
                          <code>
                            <pre>
                            C = np.matrix([[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
                                     [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
                                     [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
                                     [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]]) 
                                   </pre>
                          </code>
                          whereas this week the C matrix is only 
                      <code>
                        <pre>
                          #Measure one state only
                      C = np.matrix([[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0]]) 
                      </pre>
                      </code>
                      Indicating that the only state being measured is the fourth, which is theta dot in this code. 
                      <br>
                      Using the function print(control.obsv(P.A,P.C)) I see that the matrix is
                      <br>
                      <img src="obsCA.PNG" alt="i2c1" width="320" height="240">
                      <br> 
                      I think that because the first row has no value in the first columm, the x state is not observable. However, we already knew fromm the C matrix that only theta dot is being observed, and the rest are being estimated. it is only important that the theta dot in this matrix is observable, which it is. 


    <h2>Adding Noise</h2>
                      <br>
                      First to simulate process noise in the Kalman filter, I commented out the line 
                      <code>
                      <pre>
                        #with process noise:
                         dydt = [ydot0 + np.random.randn()*0.01, ydot1 + np.random.randn()*0.01, ydot2 + np.random.randn()*0.01, ydot3 + np.random.randn()*0.01]
                    </pre>
                    </code>
                    The Kalman filter still worked, though slightly less smoothly
