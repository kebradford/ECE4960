    <center><h2>Objective </h2></center>
    
      <p>Run Bluetooth between the artemis board and the computer</p>
      <br>
    <br>
    <center><h2>Materials Used</h2></center>
       <ul>
         <li>1 Artemis Nano</li>
         <li>1 USB A/C Cable</li>
         <li>1 Bluetooth USB Adapter</li>
         
       </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <center><h2>Procedure</h2></center>
    <p>
      To start with I downloaded the source code found on the course website 
      <a href="https://cei-lab.github.io/ECE4960/Lab2.html">here</a>, which had all the relevant python and c code.
      
      <br>
      I also plugged in the usb to bluetooth adapter we were given in our kits, and reran the commands to install bleak. 
      <br>
      Next, I uploaded the code to the Artemis board from the Arduino IDE, confirming that the blue LED blinked and the serial monitor printed the requisite information

      <br>
      Next, I ensured I could use USB devices in the VM by enabling them in VirtualBox manager
      <br>
       After first running main.py in the VM, I got bleak errors. Then, I got bluetooth adapter not found issues. After some headscratching and good-ole ECE turning it off and turning it back on again, I found that I had to reconnect the bluetooth module after the VM was already running, else it would not be found. It finally found my device! I added the robot's address to settings.py as well to speed up the process in the future. 

      <br>
      <h3>Ping Robot</h3>
      Now I moved on to the Ping Robot stage. 
      I simply edited the myRobotTasks() code to run <code>await theRobot.ping()</code>
      <br>
      The pinging worked right off the bat, and I was able to collect data on the round trip time, shown below in these two histograms 
      <br>
      <center>
      <img src="pingratehistogram.PNG" alt="ping rate">
      </center>
      <br>
      Oddly enough, the ping rate went down after a short period of time, shown below 
      <center>
      <img src="pingratetime.PNG" alt="ping rate">
      </center>
      <br>
      However, the average ping rate was around 161ms with a standard deviation of 41ms 
      <br>
      <br>
      The packet size is defined in __bleak_ping, which length to PING.Value (1 byte) + 98 zeros; a total of 99 bytes. 
      <br>
      Given an average of .161 seconds per message, this results in around 614 bytes/sec (or 4919 bits/sec). This is round trip time, however, so one side will send at around 10kb/sec. This is about an order of magnitude slower than our baud rate for serial of 115200 symbols/sec, which adds up for wireless communication. 
      <br>
      <h3>Request Float</h3>
      Next, I went through the process of requesting a float from the device, which I decided to make pi to 5 digits. 
      <br>
      I first started by trying to just write to res_cmd->data directly, but when that errored out on me, I took a look at 
      <code >case START_BYTESTREAM_TX </code>, which showed that there was a tricky type-conversion format that I was unfamiliar with. Copying that, I added  <code >((float *)(res_cmd->data))[0] = 3.14159f;</code>, and changed TODO_VAL to 1. When I tried that, I got the error that it needed 4 bytes, so I changed the number to 4, but that still didn't work. 
      <center>
      <img src="errror_length.PNG" alt="ping rate">
      </center>

      Then, I learned I needed 1 byte for the length and one for the type, and tried that (6). Still, nothing worked. So I tried the suggestion on campuswire to print the raw value of what I was sending, and realized I forgot to add the command_type. 
      <center>
      <img src="error_4bytes.PNG" alt="ping rate">
      </center>
      I went to simpleHandler in main.py and found Commands.GIVE_FLOAT.value. Finally, I added that, et voila. 

      <center>
      <img src="correctfloat.PNG" alt="ping rate">
      </center>

      <code><pre>
        case REQ_FLOAT:
            Serial.println("Going to send a float");

            res_cmd->command_type = GIVE_FLOAT;
            res_cmd->length = 8; 
            ((float *)(res_cmd->data))[0] = 3.14159f;
            
            amdtpsSendData((uint8_t *)res_cmd, 6);
            
            break;

      </pre></code>

      <br>
      <h3>Testing the Data Rate</h3>
      Last but *certainly* not least was testing the data rate 
      <br>
      At first, I tried just setting <code>bytestream_active = true;</code> in <code>case START_BYTESTREAM_TX:</code> and adding a 32 bit value to the amdtpsSendData function, setting the length to 6, and setting command_type to BYTESTREAM_TX. I was getting errors about the having bad chars. 
      <br>
      Next, I tried adding <code>bytestream_active = false;</code> after it had sent once, and actually looking at the raw output again. 
      <br>
      I ended up adding <code>await theRobot.sendCommand(Commands.REQ_FLOAT)</code> instead of using <code>await theRobot.testByteStream(25) </code>, because I wasn't entirely sure what was going on there, and using the memcpy() function suggested on campuswire. Finally, I was not getting any errors. 
      <br>
      Next, I added the unpacking function to that case. I looked at the GIVE_FLOAT example for reference, which used the unpack() function and left-carrot f, which was unfamiliar to me. Googling it led me to <a href=" https://docs.python.org/2/library/struct.html">this documenation for structs</a>, showing me how to properly unpack the structs for different sizes. 
      <br>
      Once I did that, and used the right sizes, I was able to send a 32 bit integer via this function! <br>
      <center>
      <img src="32bit_num.PNG" alt="32bit num">
      </center>
      <br>
      I tested it with both a 32bit and 64 bit integer with these results. <br>
      <center>
      <img src="14bit_rate.PNG" alt="14byte">
      </center>
      <br>
      The average round trip time was 10.69 ms, and a loss of around 18% based on how many packets were sent and how many were recieved. 
      <code><pre>
  if (bytestream_active)
    {

        res_cmd->command_type = BYTESTREAM_TX;
        res_cmd->length = 64;
        //TODO: Put an example of a 32-bit integer and a 64-bit integer
        //for the stream. Be sure to add a corresponding case in the
        //python program.

        uint32_t numToSendShort = 15960;
        uint64_t numToSendLong  = 100000007;

        memcpy(res_cmd->data, &numToSendShort, 4);
        memcpy(res_cmd->data+4, &numToSendLong, 8);

        
        //Serial.printf("Stream %d \n", bytestream_active);
        amdtpsSendData((uint8_t *)res_cmd, 14);

        unsigned long timePassed = micros();
        
        Serial.printf("Cycle %d took %d us\n", numByteStreams, timePassed); 
        numByteStreams += 1;
        
    }

      </pre></code>
