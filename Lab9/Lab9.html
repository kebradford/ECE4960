      <p>Offline Localization</p>

    <p>
        <br>
        I started with offline localization. I copied over my map data from Lab7. 
        <br>
      <img src="map_setup.PNG">
    <br>
    I then had to update the mapper call to fit my bounds. I updated min and max x/y as well as the cell size to fit my grid, which resulted in a mapper call of 

     <code><pre>
  mapper = Mapper(min_x=-1.85, max_x=.2, min_y=-.79, max_y=0, min_a=-180, max_a=180,
                cell_size_x=0.1025, cell_size_y=0.0395, cell_size_a=20,
                max_cells_x=20, max_cells_y=20, max_cells_a=18,
                ray_length=3, lines=[start_points, end_points], obs_per_cell=18, 
                robot=robot)
    </pre></code>
    <br>
    Then, I ran a scan at a given point (-.55, -.37) on my floor. I paired down the data to 18 points evenly spaced by 20 degrees and wrote that data to loc.obs_range_data for the Bayes filter to try and guess where I was. It did a fairly good job, a few cells off, but my cells were very very small to begin with. 

    <br>
      <img src="offline_close.PNG"><img src="offline_compare2.PNG">
    <br>

    These were both fairly close to the two locations I had the robot scan from, with the actual location in green and the projected in yellow. 
    <br>
      <img src="offline_belbar.PNG"><img src="offline_belbar2.PNG">
    <br>
    The confidence was not particularly high, likely due to how small the cells were and how the gyro drifts slightly during measurements, but I believe it would be good enough to do mapping later on in labs. 
    <br>
    Next, I moved to online mode. First, I played around with Bluetooth ensuring I could also recieve bluetooth commands on the artemis, which I accomplished using the await theRobot.sendMessage() function. This ended up being fairly easy to implement, so I was able to send a command to tell the robot to perform a scan. I wrote this data to a file, where I paired down the data into the closest increments to 20 degrees as possible. 

<code><pre> 
  if(unpack("IQ", data)[0] >= nextIndex + 20):
                    print(unpack("IQ", data))
                    
                    f = open(scan.txt", "a")
                    f.write(str(unpack("IQ", data)))
                    f.write("\n")
                    f.close()
                    
                    nextIndex +=20
    </pre></code>

an example of the output can be seen here : 
<code><pre>
(0, 28)
(22, 519)
(44, 240)
(67, 635)
(80, 743)
(101, 476)
(122, 351)
(141, 208)
(160, 106)
(180, 277)
(202, 250)
(223, 278)
(242, 260)
(261, 188)
(282, 472)
(309, 296)
(324, 86)
(343, 454)
(360, 329)
    </pre></code>
Although they are not perfectly 20 degrees apart, they are fairly close. I can then read this file into Jupyter lab when a scan is requested. The scan stops at 360 degrees.

The next challenge was getting the asyncronous bluetooth script to integrate with the Jupyter notebook. I struggled with this for a while until Alex posted his video with suggestions on how to integrate the bluetooth code into Jupyter notebook. I brought all the files into the jupyter notebook, created a robot class to reference, and imported main directly into jupyter script. I added a short bit of code to pull the robot into the script 
<code><pre>
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
asyncio.gather(robotTest(loop))
theRobot = theRobotHolder.getRobot()
    </pre></code>
    After this, and toying around with bluetooth settings in my host OS, I finally got the two communicating 

    <br>

    <br>

    After that, I started to port over the code I had written for the bluetooth script into the new code. Again following Alex's suggestion, I added a doScan function into ECE4960robot.py, which would send a command over bluetooth to have the robot do a scan, pretty much the same as I was doing in the offline mode, but instead of writing to a file, I wrote to a variable self.obs_array which would store approximately every 20 degrees of my scan, which were all sent over bluetooth. 

<code><pre>
    async def doScan(self): 
        await self.sendMessage("observe")
        while(not self.obs_array):
            await asyncio.sleep(.1)
        await asyncio.sleep(5)
        return self.obsData
</pre></code>

I was able to return every (approximately) 20 degrees from the TOF sensor into this variable, which I can then feed into the Bayes filter code in the RealRobot function. For the time being I set odometry to be hardcoded, because I wanted to see if just the scanning would work without also incorporating motion. I added this, called it to set loc.obs_range_data, and the Bayes filter returned the approximate position!
It returned very similarly to how the sim lab9 code did, as shown above.

    <br>
    This was super exciting as it showed that my code worked for spinning the robot on the map and returning a (roughly) correct position! At this point I decided to take a break and do the odometry/motion on everyone's favorite day to work, tomorrow. 
    <br>
    Unfortunately, when I returned, my Bluetooth was no longer functional. Due to not wanting to lose more slip days or horus or sleep on this lab, I decided to give it a rest, therefore I will not be finishing the lab.
