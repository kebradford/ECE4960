    <center><h2>Objective </h2></center>
    <p>
      The objective of this lab was to incorporate old labs and accomplish navigation and planning both in simulation and on the physical robot, ideally using things from previous labs. 
    <h3>Simulation </h3>
    To start with, I worked on the robot in simulation. First, I opened up the provided code for lab10 and subbed in my own matrix, based on the room space that I had mapped in lab 7 and have been working with since. Next, I looked into different algorithms for navigation and planning from our lectures earlier this semester. I decided that by far the easiest, and very doable given my configuration, would be a Bug algorithm. Looking through them, I found the most efficient to be the Bug2 algorithm, which follows a vector towards the goal until it runs into an obstacle, then circumnavigates that obstacle until it can get back on track towards the goal. 
    <br>

    <br>
    To implement this, I first created a simple function that in planner_query.py that would call the start and end point calculated randomly by the script, and calculate block by block the fastest way there. I did this in only two dimensions, allowing the robot to move up, down, left or right only. The script simply checks if the next best step is right, left, up or down, based on how large the delta Y and delta X are, and attempts to move in that direction. If there is a wall in that direction, the follow wall script is called. This code is called iteratively, so that each time a new point is calculated, that becomes "currPoints", and goal points stays the same, so the script terminates when currPoints = goalPoints. 

    <h3>Going to the next step </h3>
    <code><pre> 
      def add_line(self, currPoints, goalPoints): 
        
        deltaX = -currPoints[1] + goalPoints[1]
        deltaY = -currPoints[0] + goalPoints[0]
        
        if (abs(deltaX) > abs(deltaY)):
            if(deltaX > 0): #positive delta
                if(self.grid[currPoints[0], currPoints[1]+1] == 1): #obstacle that way       
                    delta_out = self.follow_wall(currPoints, goalPoints, 0) #todo: implement
                    return delta_out
                else: #no obstacle, go that way 
                    return currPoints[0], currPoints[1]+1
                
            else: #negative delta 
                if(self.grid[currPoints[0], currPoints[1]-1] == 1): #obstacle that way

                if(self.grid[currPoints[0]+1, currPoints[1]] == 1): #obstacle that way       
                    delta_out = self.follow_wall(currPoints, goalPoints, 2) #todo: implement

                    return delta_out
                else: #no obstacle, go that way

    Wall following is very naive: it first calculates where the walls are in relation to the current position, knowing the direction the robot would ideally like to move in, and picks the next best option. For instance, if the robot would like to move left, but moving down would also help get closer to the goal, it moves in that direction. This algorithm deprioritizes but still allows for moving away from the goal if that is the only option. Below are several examples of the algorithm working. I did not originally have a large obstacle that would obstruct many paths, so I later added a false obstacle to ensure the wall following was working as intended.

    Now that I had a working algorithm, I wanted to incorporate it into the simulator to visualize how the robot should move along these pre-ordained vectors. I first had to translate the provided points into map coordinates, which was a simple conversion 
    <code><pre> 
      stepY = (interm_steps[i+1][0]*-.79/16)*2;
      stepX = (interm_steps[i+1][1]*(2.05/23)-1.85)*2;
    </pre></code>

    Once I had done that, I could visualize these points by entering them iteratively as ground truth points on the simulator, which immediately worked very well.

    <br>
    Next, I wanted to set up the world so that I could test the robot moving around similar to how mine would in real life. With some help from Vivek on Campuswire, I edited my playground script to set up the simulator in the same way my world was set up, and changed the starting position of the robot to the starting position as generated by the random placement generator. After that, I simply looped through each of the points in the previously generated navigation plan, converting them to the map, and sending it to the robot to move. 

    <code><pre> 
      # Reset Plots
      robot.reset()
      loc.plotter.reset_plot()

      for i in range(len(interm_steps)):
          #print(interm_steps[i])
          nextStepY = (interm_steps[i][0]*-.79/16)*2;
          nextStepX = (interm_steps[i][1]*(2.05/23)-1.85)*2;

          
          loc.plotter.plot_point(nextStepX, nextStepY, GT)
              
          if(i is not len(interm_steps)-1):
              stepY = (interm_steps[i+1][0]*-.79/16)*2;
              stepX = (interm_steps[i+1][1]*(2.05/23)-1.85)*2;

              move_to_next((nextStepX,nextStepY, 0), (stepX,stepY, 0))
              loc.plotter.plot_point(robot.get_gt_pose()[0], robot.get_gt_pose()[1], ODOM)
    </pre></code>

    As you can see in the above code, I have a move_to_next script that actually moves the simulated robot from point to point. It uses closed loop feedback to analyze where the robot is in x, y, and theta space, and moves accordingly. For instance, in a left move, the robot will turn until the angle is 180 degrees, then it will continue slowly forward until the gt position is close enough to what the next point is supposed to be.

    <code><pre> 
      def move_to_next(currPos, nextPos):
        deltaX = nextPos [0] - currPos[0] 
        deltaY = nextPos [1] - currPos[1] 
        
        
        if(currPos[0]&gt;nextPos[0]): #moving left
            print("moving left")
            nextAng = 180;
            robot.set_vel(0,.1)
        
            while(round(robot.get_gt_pose()[2]) != nextAng): #wait till it gets to the right angle
       
            robot.set_vel(.1,0)
            while(round(robot.get_gt_pose()[0],1) != round(nextPos[0], 1)): #wait till it gets to the right distance
                
            robot.set_vel(0,0)
            
        elif(currPos[0]&lt;nextPos[0]): #moving right
            print("moving right")
            nextAng = 0;
            robot.set_vel(0,.1)
            while(round(robot.get_gt_pose()[2]) != nextAng): #wait till it gets to the right angle
   
            robot.set_vel(.1,0)
            while(round(robot.get_gt_pose()[0], 2) != round(nextPos[0], 2)): #wait till it gets to the right distance
           
            robot.set_vel(0,0)
        elif(currPos[1]&gt;nextPos[1]): #moving down
            print("moving down")
            nextAng = -90;
            robot.set_vel(0,.1)
            while(round(robot.get_gt_pose()[2]) != nextAng): #wait till it gets to the right angle
            
            robot.set_vel(.1,0)
            while(round(robot.get_gt_pose()[1], 2) != round(nextPos[1], 2)): #wait till it gets to the right distance
              
            
            robot.set_vel(0,0)
        else: #moving up
            print("moving up")
            nextAng = 90;
            robot.set_vel(0,.1)
            while(round(robot.get_gt_pose()[2]) != nextAng): #wait till it gets to the right angle
           
            robot.set_vel(.1,0)
            while(round(robot.get_gt_pose()[1], 2) != round(nextPos[1], 2)): #wait till it gets to the right distance
               
            robot.set_vel(0,0)
    </pre></code>

    As seen in the following videos, this code worked great and I was able to watch the robot move from point to point. Also included is an image of where the robot is moving vs where its supposed to be moving, which is very close. The robot moved very slowly, so this video is sped up 8x

    <h3>Real Life</h3>
    <br>
    Next, I worked on implementing this on my robot. I was actually able to largely port over the move_to_next code I used for most of the navigation. 
    <br>
    First in my Arduino script, I pass the coordinates from the calculated navigation as an array of points to be moved from. All the main script does is loop through these points, sending them to the moveToPoint script. 
<code><pre>
    void loop()
{
    setMotors(0, 0);
    for(int i = 0; i&lt;len(movePoints); i ++){ //till penultimate row 
      moveToPoint(i, movePoints[i][1], movePoints[i][0], movePoints[i+1][1], movePoints[i+1][0] ); //number, currX, currY, nextX, nextY
    }
    </pre></code>

    <br>
    To start off with, I created several helper functions that would get odometry as well as set the motor values, so that the primary script could be more concise. getYaw uses the same code as in PID and other programs earlier written that will taking a running integral of gyro values, so there is still a bit of drift, setMotors simply sets the motor values, and getDist() uses the TOF sensor to determine how far away it is from the wall or obstacle in front of it. 

    <code><pre>
      ///returns current value of yaw
          int getYaw(){
            while(not(myICM.dataReady())){}
            if( myICM.dataReady() ){
                  //Read yaw data
                  myICM.getAGMT();                // The values are only updated when you call 'getAGMT'
                  dt = (millis()-lastRead)/1000;
                  lastRead = millis();
                  yaw_g = yaw_g+myICM.gyrZ()*dt;
                  int normyaw = -1;

                  //normalize the angle
                  if(yaw_g < 0){
                    while(normyaw<0){
                      normyaw = yaw_g + 360;
                    }
                  }
                  else{
                    normyaw = yaw_g;
                  }
                  //Serial.print("Yaw:");
                  //Serial.println(yaw_g);
                  return(int(yaw_g));
               }
          }

          void setMotors(int motor1, int motor2){
            myMotorDriver.setDrive( 1, 1, motor1); 
            myMotorDriver.setDrive( 0, 1, motor2);
          }

          int getDist(){
            
            distanceSensor.startRanging(); //Write configuration bytes to initiate measurement
            distance = distanceSensor.getDistance(); //Get the result of the measurement from the sensor
            distanceSensor.clearInterrupt();
            distanceSensor.stopRanging();
            //Serial.print("Distance(mm): ");
            //Serial.println(distance);
            
            return distance;
          }

    </pre></code>
    Then, I created the main program. It essentially does the same thing as in my sim, where it determines where (up down left or right) the next point is, and then turns the robot to face in that direction and moves till it has gone far enough to be one "block," which I started as .15m.



    <code><pre>

      void moveToPoint(int i, int currX, int currY, int nextX, int nextY){


        int   currAngle  = getYaw();
        float startDist  = getDist();
        float currDist   = getDist();
        float blockDistX = 150; //how long a "block" is; will need to determine experimentally
