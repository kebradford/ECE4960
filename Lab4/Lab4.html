      <h3>4A: Open Loop Control (Real)</h3>
      <br>
      First, I connected the Artemis board to the supplied motor driver board using a Qwiic cable 
      <br><br>
      Next, I loaded up the software example "Example1_wire" to scan the i2c bus for a component, and found it at 0x5D.

      <br>
      Next, I took apart the RC car by unscrewing the top, disconnecting the control PCB, and cutting all the leads off that. 
      <br><br>
      I stripped the DC motor connector wires and screwed them into the motor controller terminals, and did the same for the battery connector. I did have to do some "refactoring" of the hot glue with a heat gun so the DC motor cables didn't rip off.

      <br>
      Next, I plugged the battery in, installed the SCMD library in Arduino, and pulled up the MotorTest script. I had to change the code a bit, first by adding the correct i2c address as found above, and then by setting i=2 for the number of motors.  They both ran from this script as shown below

      <h3>4A: Open Loop Control (Simulated)</h3>
      <br>
      Next, I set up the lab4 simulator the same way I did in lab 3, and started up jupyter labs in a terminal, which brought me to the lab4 jupyter notebook.
