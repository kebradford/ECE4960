    <h3>Grid Localization using Bayes Filter</h3>
    <br>

    The intention of this part of the lab was to write psuedo-code to acheive basic Bayes filtering tasks based on the odometry of the robot. 
    <br>
    The pre-written code was all run first, which moved the robot in a circle around an object while mapping it on the screen, like last week very inaccurately without probability based estimation. 
    <br>
    I first went back through the lectures regarding probability to re-familiarize myself with the equations and algorithms surrounding odometry based motion models. 
    <br>

      <h3>Mapping</h3>
    <br>
    This part of the lab was especially challenging due to struggles with Bluetooth. I had been having issues with bluetooth in the PID lab, which is why I chose to go with a cabled approach, but I decided I needed to figure it out sooner or later. 
    <br>
    After many hours of debugging and finally calling with Vivek, I discovered that Windows was being especially clingy with control of the Bluetooth module, so I needed to disable it and delete the drivers so the VM could have control. Finally, I could send data over bluetooth.
    <br>
    I added both Bluetooth and TOF functionality to my PID loop from last lab, simply integrating my work from the Bluetooth and TOF labs to send distance and IMU data over bluetooth to the VM. 
    <br>
    Once I got this functionality working, I tried just running the robot on my desk and plotting the polar coordinates, which seemed to be about what I expected. This is a log plot because it was dominated by the robot turning to face the room, which maxed out the sensor. 
    <br>

    <br>
    Once I had done this, I moved to cleaning and setting up my room. Although I initially intended to use my whole room, I found that it was larger than 4mx4m, and would be difficult to reduce only partially. Therefore, I set up a little corner of my room and put some boxes/bags in it.
