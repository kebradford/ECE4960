    <center><h2>Objective </h2></center>
    <p>
      The objective of this lab was to balance a rod on top of a cart using an LQR controller to stabilize it. This was done both with an ideal situation and trying to incorporate deadband, saturation, and noise. 

    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Ideal System </h3>
    <br>
    The first thing I tested was the ideal system. I first ran the simulation out of the box, ensuring that the dynamics worked as I expected. As I did in fact expect, the pendulum without any control quickly fell over and swung to a close. I changed the system parameters to fit my robot by adjusting the weight of the cart to around 560g, but other than that they all looked pretty good.

    Next, I tried implementing Kr control first using the eigenvalues suggested in lecture, which worked like a charm. for my state value I took the error measurement of the desired state differenced with the current state. 

    <code><pre> 
       import control
       dpoles = np.array([-1.1, 
                    -1.2, 
                    -1.3, 
                    -1.4])
        Kr = control.place(P.A,P.B,dpoles)

        self.u = Kr*np.subtract(des_state, curr_state) 
    </pre></code>
    <br>
    <video width="320" height="240" controls>
    <source src="dipoles.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <br>

    I tried a few different values to test a reasonable range. I made sure to keep the values negative, so that it would be stable. If they are too small, the control is not strong enough and the system becomes unstable. Around [-.5, -.6, -.7, -.8], it almost goes off screen indicating it is not stable, but recovers and stabilizes, but much smaller the control is not strong enough. Implementing too high of values actually produces a really interesting result where the control overreacts, and moves far quicker than the robot would actually be able to realistically move.

    <br>

    After toying with that, I set to setting up an LQR controller. Again, using the suggested values from lecture worked very well. 

    <code><pre> 
      Q = np.matrix([[1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
                [0.0, 1, 0.0, 0.0],
                [0.0, 0.0, 10, 0.0],
                [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 100]])
        R = np.matrix([.002])
          #solve algebraic Ricatti equation (ARE)
        S = scipy.linalg.solve_continuous_are(P.A, P.B, Q, R) 
         # Solve the ricatti equation and compute the LQR gain
        Kr = np.linalg.inv(R).dot(P.B.transpose().dot(S)) 
        self.u = Kr*np.subtract(des_state, curr_state)
    </pre></code>

    <br>

    <br>
    Increasing R never causes the system to become unstable. Knowing that the actual sensors will have some kind of noise, and that the actual actuators will have both a deadband and a saturation point, we can't have the system reacting too quickly, and it also can't make that fine of adjustments. 

    <h3>Unideal System: Deadband and Saturation </h3>

    Next, I incorporated some of the realistic non-idealities of my system into my simulated controller. First, I implemented a saturation acceleration: I know that I cannot accelerate infinitely quickly, as noted earlier when observing the quickly reacting system. I went back to lab 3 and checked out the class consensus on max acceleration, noting that it was around 330cm/s^2. Using this and the knowledge of the mass of the cart (560g), I calcuated that u could be no larger than around 1.85 (F=MA). Therefore, I set a condition that if abs(u)>1.85, it would just have to max out at 1.85. 

    <code><pre> 
         if(newU>0): 

          if(newU>1.85): self.u = np.array([1.85]) #saturation
          else: self.u = newU #normal

         else: 

             if(newU<-1.85): self.u = np.array([-1.85])
             else: self.u = newU

    </pre></code>
    This simulation ran exactly the same as before with the LQR system, without a hitch. Next, I tried implementing a deadband. The deadband was taken from the minimum velocity I could move the robot; with the tape on the wheels, this was around 80-90 out of 255. To translate this to a force, I multiplied this by the saturation velocity out of 255, to get a deadband force of around .6, conservatively. 
    <br>
    This was very difficult, and at first no matter what my Q and R, I could not seem to get a stable controller while implementing deadband. The deadband was implemented much the same as the saturation velocity, like so 
    <br>

    <code><pre> 
        if(newU>0): 

            if(newU>1.85): self.u = np.array([1.85]) #saturation

            elif(newU<0.6): self.u = 0#np.array([0.0]) #deadband

            else: self.u = newU #normal

        else: 

            if(newU<-1.85): self.u = np.array([-1.85])

            elif(newU>-0.6): self.u = 0#np.array([0.0]) #deadband

            else: self.u = newU

    </pre></code>
    <br>

    In addition, I tried splitting up the deadband, where anything below .3 would be set to zero and anything above would be set to .6, but that was not useful. Every time, I would get an error along the lines of "ODEintWarning: Excess work done on this call (perhaps wrong Dfun type). Run with full_output = 1 to get quantitative information.
  warnings.warn(warning_msg, ODEintWarning)" 
  <br>
  After some back and forth on campuswire, Kirstin and Sadie pointed out that instead of comparing my signal to a square wave, I could instead compare to a sine wave, such that the controller would always have to be moving, and never crash. At first, I was trying to change zref in pendulumControllerDynamics.py, but I learned from trial, error, and Greg that it should actually be the ref and ctrl signals in runSimulation.py. After playing around with amplitude and frequency values for this sine wave, I finally got a stable, albiet dance-y, inverted pendulum with deadband. I found the graphs interesting; here are two with different values of frequency, 1 and .6 respectively 

     <code><pre> 
      ref = signalGen(amplitude=100, frequency=1, y_offset=0) 
      ctrl = pendulumCnt(param=P,zref=ref.sin)

    </pre></code>

    <h3>Unideal System: Noise </h3>

    Finally, I incorporated noise into my system. For x noise, I used the accelerometer, as that was how I determined how far I had moved, and for the theta noise I used gyro noise, as that was how I determined which direction I was facing on the real robot. From lab 6 I could see that my accelerometer data had a std dev of noise around .2 m/s^2. The gyroscope was actually fairly low noise, with the drift being a much larger issue. I calculated the noise on the gyro to be around .1 deg/s based on lab 6.
