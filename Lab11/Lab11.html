    <p>
      The objective of this lab was to balance a rod on top of a cart using an LQR controller to stabilize it. This was done both with an ideal situation and trying to incorporate deadband, saturation, and noise. 

    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Ideal System </h3>
    <br>
    The first thing I tested was the ideal system. I first ran the simulation out of the box, ensuring that the dynamics worked as I expected. As I did in fact expect, the pendulum without any control quickly fell over and swung to a close. I changed the system parameters to fit my robot by adjusting the weight of the cart to around 560g, but other than that they all looked pretty good.

    Next, I tried implementing Kr control first using the eigenvalues suggested in lecture, which worked like a charm. for my state value I took the error measurement of the desired state differenced with the current state. 

    <code><pre> 
       import control
       dpoles = np.array([-1.1, 
                    -1.2, 
                    -1.3, 
                    -1.4])
        Kr = control.place(P.A,P.B,dpoles)

        self.u = Kr*np.subtract(des_state, curr_state) 
    </pre></code>
    <br>
    <video width="320" height="240" controls>
    <source src="dipoles.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <br>

    I tried a few different values to test a reasonable range. I made sure to keep the values negative, so that it would be stable. If they are too small, the control is not strong enough and the system becomes unstable. Around [-.5, -.6, -.7, -.8], it almost goes off screen indicating it is not stable, but recovers and stabilizes, but much smaller the control is not strong enough. Implementing too high of values actually produces a really interesting result where the control overreacts, and moves far quicker than the robot would actually be able to realistically move.

    After toying with that, I set to setting up an LQR controller. Again, using the suggested values from lecture worked very well. 

    <code><pre> 
      Q = np.matrix([[1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
                [0.0, 1, 0.0, 0.0],
                [0.0, 0.0, 10, 0.0],
                [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 100]])
        R = np.matrix([.002])
          #solve algebraic Ricatti equation (ARE)
        S = scipy.linalg.solve_continuous_are(P.A, P.B, Q, R) 
         # Solve the ricatti equation and compute the LQR gain
        Kr = np.linalg.inv(R).dot(P.B.transpose().dot(S)) 
        self.u = Kr*np.subtract(des_state, curr_state)
    </pre></code>
